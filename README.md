# Modelska analiza 1

## Overview
This repository contains projects for the course **Modelska analiza 1** (Model Analysis 1), part of the Master's program in Computational Physics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (FMF). Each project focuses on modeling various physical problems, providing insight into the methods and applications of computational modeling in physics. The projects and accompanying documentation were created in the Slovenian language.

The repository is organized by projects, each contained in its respective folder. These folders include all materials relevant to each task, such as Python code, reports, images, and data.

## Projects
1. Variacijska metoda za optimizacijo varčne vožnje

2. Linearno programiranje
3. Nelinearna minimizacija
4. Populacijski modeli


## Repository Structure
Each project folder typically includes the following files:

- **Instructions**: A description of the project objectives, problem statement, and detailed tasks. 

- **Code**: Python scripts that implement the models, calculations, and simulations required for the problem.
- **Report**: A detailed report (usually in PDF format) that discusses the problem, methodology, results, and conclusions. The report is structured to be a self-contained document, covering both the theoretical and practical aspects of the project.
- **Images**: Visualizations generated during the analysis, such as plots and diagrams, which are used to interpret and present the results effectively.
- **Data**: Any datasets needed for simulations, either provided by the course or generated during the analysis.


## Requirements
The projects are primarily developed in **Python** and require the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

Additional libraries may be specified within individual projects, depending on specific requirements.
